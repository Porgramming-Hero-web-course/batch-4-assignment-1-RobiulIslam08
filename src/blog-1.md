# The Significance of Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript

TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, brings several powerful features to the table that enhance both the safety and maintainability of your code. Among these features, **union types** and **intersection types** are two of the most significant. Understanding how to use these types effectively can elevate your TypeScript development experience, allowing you to create more flexible, robust, and reusable code.

## Union Types: Flexibility with Multiple Possible Types

Union types in TypeScript allow a variable to be one of several possible types. This is incredibly useful when a value could logically be one of many types, but you still want to ensure type safety and avoid errors.

### What Are Union Types?

A **union type** is a way of specifying that a variable can hold one of several types. You define it using the pipe (`|`) symbol. For example, if you want a variable that can hold either a number or a string, you can define it as:

```typescript
type Age = number | string;

### Example
type Age = number | string;

function handleAge(age: Age): string {
  if (typeof age === "number") {
    return `Age is a number: ${age}`;
  } else if (typeof age === "string") {
    return `Age is a string: ${age}`;
  }
  return "Invalid age";
}

console.log(handleAge(30));   // Output: Age is a number: 30
console.log(handleAge("30")); // Output: Age is a string: 30
